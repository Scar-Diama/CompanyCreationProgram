This project was made to introduce and test myself not only on C++ but on:
- Object-oriented programming and object handling
- Permanent storage of objects
- Object manipulation and editing
- Optimizing code for efficiency (The Best I could for the time)

The program allows the user to create a company as an object with attributes, store them in a CSV file, then finally pull them from the CSV file for reconstruction.

This was a very challenging project for my first dive into C++. It taught me that C++â€™s complexity is equal to its capability, allowing for precise programming.
